## Description
This project required building a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Tests were written for each part of the code using Jest to ensure that it passes all of them.

When prompted for team members and their information, then an HTML is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
